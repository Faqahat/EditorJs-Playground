## Data Structure

The plugin saves data in the following format:

```javascript
{
  url: "https://res.cloudinary.com/...",     // Cloudinary image URL
  caption: "Image caption with <b>formatting</b>", // HTML caption
  withBorder: false,                         // Border styling
  withBackground: false,                     // Background styling
  stretched: false,                          // Stretch to full width
  publicId: "cloudinary-public-id",          // Cloudinary public ID
  width: 1920,                              // Original image width
  height: 1080                              // Original image height
}
```

## Security Notes

- The plugin uses unsigned upload presets for simplicity
- For production use, consider implementing signed uploads for better security
- Configure upload restrictions in your Cloudinary preset (file size, format, etc.)
- Consider adding client-side validation for additional security

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Upload fails**: Check your cloud name and upload preset configuration
2. **CORS errors**: Ensure your upload preset allows uploads from your domain
3. **File size issues**: Configure file size limits in your Cloudinary preset

### Error Messages
